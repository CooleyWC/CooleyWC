Hello! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer specializing in Javascript and Python. I have a background in Music Performance and Music Education where I bring creativity and structure to coding. 

I approach programming problems with the same persistence, creativity, and determination as learning a new piece of music on my instrument. I’m looking to join a team where I can apply my diverse skill set to developing high-quality products.
